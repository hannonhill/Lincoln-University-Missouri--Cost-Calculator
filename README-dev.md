## Net price calculator prototype

- `prototype.html` uses a scraped page as a containerized template to render the graduate cost calculator in a layout that matches Lincoln University.
- `cost-calculator.js` contains the calculator logic (tuition, program fees, books) with query string parameter features.
- `net-price-calculator.css` adds light layout/styling on top of the site's CSS for the calculator section.
- Adjustable values live in the data- attributes in the #costCalculator HTML form in both the `prototype.html` and `prototype-isolated.html` files. These values include term, location, program fee, and book costs.
- `prototype-isolated.html` holds the standalone mockup if you need to reference the client approved design.
