# Feature Ideas

## Add project to company Github
Possibly set up GitHub Action to deploy to test URL whenever changes are pushed

## ✅ Query parameters
Leverage selected options as query params so that estimate results can be easily shared

## ✅ Customized Selects
This is gaining better browser support and can be used as a progressive enhancement. Unsupporting browsers will display native selects

## ✅ Form validation
Instead of an alert showing, highlight the section that needs to be filled out

## ✅ Reset Button
Include button to reset options to default state and clear query parameters
